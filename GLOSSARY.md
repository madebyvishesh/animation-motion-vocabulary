# Animation Motion Vocabulary — Glossary

Human-readable reference for all terms in this vocabulary. The installable agent skill is in `animation-motion-vocabulary/`. The agent's version of this glossary (with a table of contents and phrase maps) is at `animation-motion-vocabulary/references/animation-motion-vocabulary.md`.

Core vocabulary source: [Animation Vocabulary](https://animations.dev/vocabulary) by Emil Kowalski. This version adapts it for AI agent use with additional matching and implementation guidance.

## How to Use This Vocabulary

Use these terms to turn vague animation feedback into precise implementation language. If a user's wording closely matches a term, suggest the likely term. If two terms could fit, ask a short confirmation question.

Examples:

- "Make it appear" -> fade in, slide in, scale in, pop in, reveal, or enter animation.
- "Make it feel snappy" -> ease-out or a well-damped spring.
- "Make the list cascade in" -> stagger.
- "Make the card grow from the button" -> origin-aware animation.
- "The image should become the details page" -> shared element transition.
- "Make it show as I scroll" -> scroll reveal.
- "Make it move with scroll" -> scroll-driven animation.
- "Make the number roll up" -> number ticker with tabular numbers.
- "It feels laggy" -> check jank, dropped frames, layout thrashing, and compositing.

## Entrances and Exits

Fade in / Fade out: An element appears or disappears by changing opacity.

Slide in: An element enters by sliding in from off-screen: left, right, top, or bottom.

Scale in: An element grows from smaller to full size as it appears, often paired with a fade.

Pop in: An element appears with a slight overshoot, like it bounces into place.

Reveal: Content is uncovered gradually, often by animating a `clip-path` or mask.

Enter / Exit: The animation an element plays when it is added to or removed from the screen.

## Sequencing and Timing

Keyframes: Defined points in an animation, such as 0%, 50%, and 100%, that the browser fills the gaps between.

Interpolation / Tween: Generating all the in-between frames between a start and end value, so motion is continuous.

Stagger: Animate several items one after another with a small delay between each, creating a cascade.

Orchestration: Deliberately timing multiple animations so they feel like one coordinated motion.

Delay: Time before an animation starts.

Duration: How long an animation takes.

Fill mode: Whether an element keeps its first or last frame's styles before the animation starts or after it ends, such as `forwards`.

Stepped animation: An animation that is divided into discrete steps, like a countdown timer.

## Movement and Transforms

Translate: Move an element along the X or Y axis.

Scale: Make an element bigger or smaller.

Rotate: Turn an element around a point.

Skew: Slant an element along the X or Y axis, shearing it out of its rectangular shape.

3D tilt / Flip: Rotate in 3D space with `rotateX` or `rotateY` to add depth.

Perspective: How strong the 3D effect looks. A lower perspective value exaggerates depth, like the viewer is closer.

Transform origin: The anchor point a scale or rotation grows or spins from.

Origin-aware animation: An element animates out of its trigger, like a popover growing from the button that opened it instead of from its own center, which is the CSS default.

## Transitions Between States

Crossfade: One element fades out as another fades in, in the same spot.

Continuity transition: A change that keeps the user oriented by visually connecting before and after. For example, making the same rectangle bigger and smaller.

Morph: One shape smoothly turns into another shape, such as the Dynamic Island style of motion.

Shared element transition: An element travels and transforms from one position into another, like a thumbnail expanding into a card.

Layout animation: When an element's size or position changes, it animates to the new spot instead of snapping.

Accordion / Collapse: A section smoothly expands and collapses its height to show or hide content.

Direction-aware transition: Content slides one way going forward and the opposite way going back, so navigation has a sense of direction.

## Scroll

Scroll reveal: Elements fade or slide into place as they enter the viewport.

Scroll-driven animation: An animation whose progress is tied directly to scroll position.

Parallax: Background and foreground move at different speeds while scrolling, creating depth.

Page transition: An animation that plays when navigating from one page or route to another.

View transition: The browser morphs between two states or pages, connecting shared elements.

## Feedback and Interaction

Hover effect: Visual change when the cursor moves over an element.

Press / Tap feedback: A subtle scale-down when an element is clicked, so it feels physical.

Hold to confirm: A progress effect that fills up while the user holds a button.

Drag: Moving an element by grabbing it, often with momentum when released.

Drag to reorder: Dragging items in a list to rearrange them, while the others shift to make room.

Swipe to dismiss: Dragging an element off-screen to close it, like a drawer or toast.

Rubber-banding: Resistance and snap-back when you drag past a boundary, like the iOS overscroll feel.

Shake / Wiggle: A quick side-to-side jitter signaling an error or rejected input.

Ripple: A circle expanding from the point of a tap, confirming the press.

## Easing

Easing: The rate at which an animation speeds up or slows down.

Ease-out: Starts fast, ends slow. The default for most UI and anything responding to the user.

Ease-in: Starts slow, ends fast. Usually avoided; can feel sluggish.

Ease-in-out: Slow, fast, slow. Good for elements already on screen moving from A to B.

Linear: Constant speed. Avoid for UI; reserve for spinners or marquees.

Cubic-bezier: A custom easing curve you define for precise control.

Asymmetric easing: A curve that accelerates and decelerates at different rates. Feels more alive than a symmetric one.

## Spring Animations

Spring: Motion driven by physics, such as tension, mass, and damping, rather than a set duration.

Stiffness / Tension: How strongly the spring pulls toward its target. Higher feels snappier.

Damping: How quickly a spring settles. Lower damping means more bounce and oscillation.

Mass: How heavy the animated element feels. More mass makes it slower and more sluggish.

Bounce: A spring that overshoots and settles, adding playfulness.

Perceptual duration: How long a spring feels finished, even though it keeps micro-settling underneath.

Momentum: Motion that carries velocity, especially after a drag or interruption.

Velocity: How fast and in which direction an element is moving. A spring carries it into the next animation when interrupted, so a flicked element keeps its speed.

Interruptible animation: An animation that can be smoothly redirected mid-flight instead of finishing first.

## Looping and Ambient Motion

Marquee: Text or content that scrolls continuously in a loop.

Loop: An animation that repeats, a set number of times or infinitely.

Alternate (yoyo): A loop that plays forward then reverses each iteration, instead of jumping back to the start.

Orbit: An element circling around another in a continuous path.

Pulse: A gentle repeating scale or opacity change to draw attention.

Float: A gentle, continuous up-and-down drift that makes a static element feel alive and weightless.

Idle animation: Subtle motion that plays while an element is just sitting there, waiting to be interacted with.

## Polish and Effects

Blur: A blur filter used to soften an element or mask tiny imperfections.

Clip-path: Clipping an element to a shape, used for reveals, masks, and before/after sliders.

Mask: Hiding or revealing parts of an element using a shape or gradient, like clip-path but with soft, fadeable edges.

Before / after slider: A draggable divider that wipes between two overlaid images to compare them.

Line drawing: An SVG path that draws itself in, like an invisible pen tracing it.

Text morph: Text that animates character by character when it changes, drawing attention to the new value.

Skeleton / Shimmer: A placeholder with a moving sheen shown while content loads.

Number ticker: Digits rolling or counting up to a value.

Tabular numbers: Fixed-width digits so numbers do not shift around as they change. Essential for tickers, timers, and counters.

Typewriter: Text appearing one character at a time, as if being typed.

## Performance

Frame rate (FPS): Frames drawn per second. 60fps is the baseline for smooth motion; 120fps on newer displays.

Jank: Visible stutter when the browser drops frames because it cannot keep up with the animation.

Dropped frame: A frame the browser missed its deadline to draw, causing a tiny hitch in motion.

Compositing: Letting the GPU move or fade an element on its own layer without redoing layout or paint.

will-change: A CSS hint that an element is about to animate, so the browser can promote it to its own layer ahead of time.

Layout thrashing: Animating properties like width, height, top, or left that force the browser to recalculate layout every frame, causing jank.

## Principles to Know

Purposeful animation: Motion should serve a function: orient, give feedback, show relationships, not just decorate.

Anticipation: A small wind-up in the opposite direction before a move, hinting at what is about to happen.

Follow-through: Parts of an element keep moving and settle slightly after the main motion stops, adding weight.

Squash and stretch: Deforming an element as it moves to convey weight, speed, and flexibility.

Perceived performance: The right animation makes an interface feel faster, even when it is not.

Frequency of use: The more often a user sees an animation, the shorter and subtler it should be.

Spatial consistency: Animating so an element keeps its identity and position across states, so users never lose track of where things went.

Hardware acceleration: Animating transform and opacity lets the GPU keep motion smooth.

Reduced motion: Respecting the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting by toning down or removing motion.
